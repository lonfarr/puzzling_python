# Puzzling Python

This repo contains a series of examples of strange Python behaviors. These are based on my rememberance of posts that I made while working at Meta that I thought would be fun to share.

Each file corresponds to a post on [lonfarr.com](https://www.lonfarr.com), where the post is directly linked in each file and in the table of contents below.

I'd highly recommend looking at the post on the website since it has additional information beyond what is in the code. This repo mainly serves as a place for the code to live and others to find it.

# Acknowledgements and Inspirations
I'd like to call out several locations where I learned about these quirks. While I do try to recognize them in the individual posts, I want to have a full list here along side the code to direct people to these interesting resources.
* [wtfpython GitHub](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython)
  * A great GitHub (much greater than this one) with many examples. The readme is heavily detailed and you don't really even need to look at the code in the repo. A lot of my more detailed puzzles/examples were inspired by these relatively simple examples.
* [mCoding YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mCoding)
  * mCoding has a variety of videos on C++, Python, and Math. The Python videos do go into some depth of the inner workings of Python and led to some of the ideas for my posts.
