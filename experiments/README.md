# Experiments Folder

This folder contains files that are smaller experiments without a full post on my blog. These are mostly to test a little thing that maybe didn't spur a full post, but was still interesting and I want to save for posterity.

Files here shall pass black formatting, and pyright (unless something is ignored on purpose). Otherwise, files are provided as-is since they may not be trying to tell a complete story.

Each file shall start with a doc string describing what the file is trying to show. Other documentation will be lacking compared to the main blog post files.
